# Peer5 Interview

Welcome to the hands-on interview question for Peer5.
If you got here, it means you probably have what it takes to be part of our amazing team.
This part is a coding session where you will be given a general description of something to implement.

Before you begin, some things to pay attention to:

1. Write code like you would write for a real-world production product.
2. Feel free to use any online resource you may find.
3. Write tests for the code you write.
4. Try to write your code as efficient as possible. (In big O terms)
5. We have already prepared the testing framework for you, so you can just run `npm run test` in order to run your tests.

If you have ANY questions during the interview, feel free to ask us and we'll be happy to help.

The task: Please implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache module, without using existing modules.

You are given 2 hours to complete the interview.
